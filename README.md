âœ… Why Use File I/O?
Without file I/O, all data is lost when the program ends. File I/O allows:
Persistence: Save user-created data (like tasks) to disk.
Portability: Share or back up data easily (via .txt or .json files).
No database needed: Good for small projects.

Where File I/O Happens in CRUD:
CRUD Operation	File I/O Involvement
Create	Write new data to the file.
Read	Load data from the file at startup.
Update	Modify data in memory, then save to file.
Delete	Remove data in memory, then save to file.
